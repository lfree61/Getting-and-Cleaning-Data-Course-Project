Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
========================================

Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data-- Johns Hopkins Specialization

This project contains an R script (run_analysis.R) that creates two tidy datasets from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0 (found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphone). 

The first resulting dataset (tidy_data1.csv) contains measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

The second resulting dataset (tidy_data2.csv) contains the average of each variable from tidy_data1.csv for each activity and each subject.

Please see the CookBook.md file for more instructions on how these datasets were created.
